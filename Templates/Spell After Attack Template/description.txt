Spell After Attack Template

Author: Archer30


Spell After Attack template for creating your unique Casting Spell after attack ability. 
It is possible to set an alternative spell with the template which would be casted only when the attacked creature is processed with another spell (similar to Sorceress in HotA).
All the settings are in ...Mods\Spell After Attack Template\\Data\s\0 spell after attack - creature.erm.

In order to set up Spell After Attack for a creature, simply modify the settings in 0 spell after attack - creature.erm to the values you like. 

The second or more Spell After Attack abilities needs to be created by copying 0 spell after attack - creature.erm to the same location and rename "0" to another number. Also replace all the "0_" with "[custom number]_" in the new script (by pressing "Ctrl+H" from the text editor).
